Component Begin Overlap:
NotifyComponentBeginOverlap(UPrimitiveComponent* OverlappedComponent, AActor* OtherActor,
	                                        UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComp, int32 OtherBodyIndex, bool bFromSweep,
	                                        const FHitResult& SweepResult);

Component End Overlap:
NotifyComponentEndOverlap(UPrimitiveComponent* OverlappedComp,
		AActor* OtherActor, UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComp, int32 OtherBodyIndex);

AIController C++:
- Go to Project.build.cs
- Add "AIModule" to "PublicDependencyModuleNames"

To Use AAIController Function "MoveTo":
- Create struct FAIMoveRequest
- Add To Created struct Destination (actor or location)
- Set bool In Created struct SetUsePathfinding(true) to true

Add Components At Run Time:

NewComponent = NewObject<UClass>(AParent, UClass::StaticClass(), "Name");
NewComponent->SetupAttachment(AParent);
NewComponent->RegisterComponent(); // Always After Attachment or Later
GetOwner()->AddInstanceComponent(NewComponent); // To Apear Component In Runtime List
